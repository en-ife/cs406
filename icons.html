          <img src="Ruth Bader Ginsburg.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Ruth Bader Ginsburg was American lawyer and 
          jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993 - 2020. During her 
          first year of law school in 1956,  her husband was diagnosed with cancer. Ginsburg took on the challenge of keeping 
          her sick partner up-to-date with his academocs while maintaining her own position at the top of the class. At Harvard, Ginsburg 
          was one of nine women in a 500-person class. She was the first female member of the Harvard Law Review, and first 
          in her class at Columbia Law in 1959. In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, holding that 
          qualified women could not be denied admission to Virginia Military Institute. Until the 2018 term, Ginsburg had not missed a 
          day of oral arguments, even when undergoing chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, was recovering from surgery for colon cancer, 
          or the day after her husband passed away in 2010. ">
          <img src="Rosa Parks.jpg" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Rosa Parks was a pioneering American activist in the 
          civil rights movement best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott. She helped initiate the civil rights movement 
          in the United States when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955. Her actions 
          inspired the leaders of the local Black community to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
          King Jr., the boycott lasted more than a year—during which Parks not coincidentally lost her job—and ended only when the U.S. 
          Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. The United States Congress has honored her as 'the first lady of 
          civil rights' and 'the mother of the freedom movement'">

          A pioneer of early television, with a television career spanning more than seven decades, White was noted for her vast work in 
          the entertainment industry and being one of the first women to work both in front of and behind the camera.">

          rights advocate and political activist. Born in West Tuscumbia, Alabama, she lost her sight and her hearing after an illness at 
          the age of 19 months. She then communicated primarily using home signs until the age of seven, when she met her first teacher and 
          life-long companion Anne Sullivan. This young woman taught Keller language, including reading and writing. After an education at 
          both specialist and mainstream schools, Keller attended Radcliffe College of Harvard University and became the first deafblind 
          person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree.">
